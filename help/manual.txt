*********
INTROITUS
*********

The Legend of Saladir is a roguelike role playing game. The game is
set in a fantasy world called Salmorria. You have been given the shoes
of an burly adventurer seeking for glorious quests and big amounts
gold. 


**********
BRIEF NOTE About the latest version V0.34
**********

At first, sorry for the *long* delay. Almost exactly a year has passed
since the last public release. I don't know what happened and I really
can't believe that a year has passed. But now, here it is, a new
version of the game. It might not be what you've been waiting for but
still, there're a lot of new features in. 

I also know that this version might not be very playable and doesn't
contain much new game content. The main focus lately has been in the
game engine which makes all the nice things possible. But for the next
version I will try to tune up things a bit, add more towns and
dungeons, quests and so on.

So what about the new features since V0.30 ?

The most important (and probably not working) feature is the SAVE/LOAD
feature. It allows you to save and load games in any point of the
game. You can use :L to load and :S for saving.

If you want to know more about these changes, read the included text file,
history.txt.

As you see, the quest code is now included, but it's not fully working
yet. You can find some quests and some of them you can also
complete. But the system needs a lot more work.




About the Linux port
-------------------- 
I am pretty sure the Linux version contains a lot of bugs and other silly
quirks but I've TRIED my best with the current Linux knowledge I have. I
must admit that I am a Linux newbie, and this is absolutely the first Linux
program I've ever made with C/C++. But what I've tested, it works atleast in
my system and it hasn't caused any system corruptions (yet). There's one
advice for you:

                    !DON'T PLAY THIS GAME AS A ROOT!

Either use your secondary "user" account or set it for global system use as
described in Linux_readme.txt. In any case, don't play as the root, please!
This is an advice from one Linux user to another.


Any comments relating to the game can forwarded to me via email:
ernomat@evitech.fi

P.S. This document will eventually evolve into a Legend of Saladir Manual.
Hopefully.



*****************
STARTING THE GAME
*****************

Requirements:
-------------

The Legend of Saladir needs either a DOS/WIN95 or (from V0.30 on) a Linux
operating system. Currently there're only versions for IBM PC (i386)
compatibles.

The DOS/WIN95 version requires DPMI-services because it was compiled with a
real 32-bit compiler (DJGPP). DPMI comes with Windows, but if you're playing
in the DOS environment then you need to use ie. CWSDPMI.EXE. (Included with
the DOS version)

Linux version has been compiled with GNU's glibc2 (V2.0.7-5, aka libc6) and
requires ELF support from your kernel. Both dynamically and statically
linked versions are available. Static version dont't need any external
libraries but requires more memory and disk space.

Tech: The Linux version has been compiled with GNU CC (gcc) V2.8.1-1) and
the DOS version with DJGPP V2.01 which is based on GNU CC V2.7.x versions.
The system used for developing is a self built (with care and love) IBM-PC
compatible equipped with AMD-K6 200MHz, 128MB RAM, 2.5GB HD, S3 Virge (+
Diamond Monster3D Voodoo2 3Dfx), Linux 2.103 and Win95.

Starting in DOS/WIN95: 
---------------------- 

Start the game from the same directory where files SALADIR.EXE and
OUTWORLD.MAP are located.

When starting, Saladir will make a temporary directory called TEMPDATA under
the same directory where SALADIR.EXE is located. The game will use this
directory to store some temporary data it needs. Do not delete files inside
this directory when playing the game, Saladir will eventually delete all
files it has created.

Linux 
----- 

First of all, read the file Linux_readme.txt for further instructions on how
to install the game for Linux systems. 

Basically you don't need to do anything special, if you're playing the game
just by yourself, but if you're in a multiuser system and many users have
access to the game you might want to check the better way to install the
game.

The above instructions are mostly true for Linux too. Due to the multiuser
nature, the Linux version handles some things a bit different.

Temporary files will be saved in the HOME-directory of the current user who
is playing the game. The temp directory will be named as "~/.saladirtmp".

Start the game with command "saladir" or "saladir-static" for statically
linked version.


Optional command line options in all versions:

 -s	if you don't want the "animated logo" pop up when the game starts,
	putting this will skip it.
 -l     Displays the license for the game.




************************ 
CREATING YOUR ADVENTURER 
************************

After the game has loaded, you will be prompted for a name, this is what you
will be known as in the game and score table. If you have difficulties
thinking names for your character, like I do, you can just press enter and
let the game create a unique name for you. Try my "Name-o-Matic". :) A word
of warning, it sometimes creates quite silly names. :)

The character generation in Saladir is still very unfinished. But here's how
it works for now.

Your character will be built in two stages. 
	1) Issue the attributes (STR, DEX, etc) which determine
	   your physical and mental condition.
	2) Learn the skills, ie. select your background

These two tasks can either be done by the computer automatically (Let the
fate decide) or by yourself.

Attribute points will, in any case, be distributed randomly. But in manual
mode you have a lot more freedom to edit them.

In the second stage, you learn the skills and your knowledge. This is done
by selecting teachers. They will teach you some skills they have in their
knowledge. In automatic mode, teachers will be selected
automatically. Afterwards you will be issued some items relating to your
skills. Ie. you get a random weapon suited for your best weapon skill.

I've tried to make this as straightforward as possible, so it should be easy
to use and understand.

(Note! In this version, you can't edit CHARISMA, WISDOM or INTELLIGENCE
values because these stats won't really affect anything inside the game for
now. If I let you edit the stats you could decrease them into a minimum and
create a character with STR=99, DEX=99, etc. Pretty damn god to me...)



*****************
KEYBOARD COMMANDS
*****************

The latest list of available key commands can always be seen inside the game
by using the internal help features. Press key sequence ":?k" to get
keyboard help directly, or press '?' to get the help menu where you can
choose all the other help options too.

(Note: The command interface has been redesigned after V0.30. It works very
much like in ADOM for example.)


Keyboard interface
------------------

Some commands work with a single key press and some require multiple keys to
be pressed in sequence. For example, in the list you can find a command
":1". To execute the command you must press first ':' followed by
'1'. There's no timeout delay in multiple keypresses, you've got all the
time you need to finish the command.

When you're pressing keys for a multikey command, you will see all your
previous keypresses at the top of your screen. When all keys for the command
have been pressed the command will activate.

In the keyboard list below, ^ followed by a letter (ie. ^A) means that you
need to press CTRL+<letter> together.


Here is a list of (currently) available operations and commands

ABOUT GAME PLOT/GOALS
*********************

... you are an adventurer, go check it out.

Please join my mailinglist (check below) and we can discuss everything
closely. 

(mailinglist temporarily closed due to some problems ...)


******************
SAVING AND LOADING
******************

You can save a game anytime by using ':S' command and load it back by
pressing ':L' while playing the game.

Also when you quit the game, you will be asked if you would like to
save the current situation. 

When you start the game and type in the name of your character you
will have a choice to restore a saved game if one exists.


****************
INVENTORY SYSTEM
****************

Everything you pick up, is stored in your main backpack. This backpack can't
be removed, it's always travelling with you. You can access your items by
invoking the inventory screen by pressing 'i', this will open a new screen
which is a view to your inventory.

Not only you, but also all the other beings, persons and some special items
can have exactly similar inventories. Some creature can carry its own
backpack and some items (a bag for example) can have items stored inside it.

When you press 'i' you will see a list of items and some brief instructions
on how to use the inventory system. On the top of the screen, there's a
header area which occupies a couple of lines. On the bottom of the screen,
there's a footer area describing the commands available to you. Between
these two sections you see an area reserved for item information, this area
will list all your items.

If you're carrying many items, it might be that all your items won't fit to
the visible screen area. You can scroll the middle section up/down with
these commands:

	2 or DOWN	line down
	3 or PGDN	page down
	8 or UP		line up
	9 or PGUP	page up

In the middle section you can see item names and some of the item details.
This section is grouped by and sorted by using the item group as a
key. Those lines look like this:

--[ ( ]-- One Handed Weapons
  A) a new elven staff
  B) a rusty iron sword

First line tells what item gategory is in question. This like will show up
the letter describing the item (the item will show up in the map with this
letter) and the name of the gategory.

After the gategory line there're all items belonging to this group. The
first letter (from A to Z) will display a key which you can use to access
the item.


Filtering out items
-------------------

The inventory browser can filter out all items not belonging into a selected
item group. Press the item symbol (the symbol you see when you walk around
the dungeon) to select the group you want to view.

For example, press $ to get only items belongig to MONEY-gategory. Press %
to get only food and corpses. And so on.


Selecting items 
--------------- 

Some of the commands and operations will open up your inventory window where
you can select the item you want to use with the command in question. For
example, when you try to pick up an item you will be shown a list of items
you can pick up from the floor/ground. 

Some of the commands will allow selecting multiple items and some will
require only one item for the operation. 

You can select multiple items (if the command supports that!) by pressing
the item letter with SHIFT. So if you want to select items "a" and "b" from
the list, press SHIFT+A and SHIFT+B to select the items. When you close the
item screen with SPACE, the command will be executed with all items you
selected.

However, if the command only requires only one item then the first item you
selected will be used for the command, even if you try pressing
SHIFT+<letter>.

NOTE: Commands can be applied only on items stored in your main
inventory. Items inside any container will be first transferred to the main
inventory first. Read more below.


Container items (items inside items)
------------------------------------

Here's a sample hierarchial view of a sample inventory you might have during
some point of your game.

	Your inventory
	             |
	             sword
	             bag
	             | |
	             | 21 gold coins
	             | 15 copper coins
	             | purse
	             | |   |
	             | |   diamond
	             | |   magic marker  
	             | |
	             | a letter
	             | 
	             a scroll of genocide


Your main inventory contains items:
	sword, bag and a scroll of genocide

The bag inside your main inventory contains:
	21 gold coins
	15 copper coins
	purse
	a letter

The purse inside the bag contains:
	diamond
	magic marker

If the inventory you're looking at contains any container items, ie. bags,
purses or chests, you can open them up by pressing command CTRL+O and then
selecting the container you want to open up. At any time you can open up
your inventory and transfer items between your main inventory and the
container you're carrying (same applies to the containers lying on the
ground). 


Transferring items from a container
-----------------------------------

You can open a container with command CTRL+O. 

If you open a container, and then select any items you will transfer all the
selected items to the PREVIOUS inventory level you were looking at before
opening up the current container. The transfer will happen when you CONFIRM
your item selection (multiselection -> confirm with ENTER, cancel with
SPACE/ESC).

Items can be transferred *TO* the previous inventory level only. 

A step by step example, look at the sample hierarchial picture above:

1) You open your inventory
   you see items:   sword, bag and a scroll of genocide
2) You press CTRL+O (open a container) and select the BAG
   you see items:   21 gold, 15 copper, purse, a letter
3) You press the letter of "21 Gold coins" (single selection without SHIFT)
4) the container screen will close and you see that all 21 Gold coins were
   transferred to your main inventory.

Another step by step example:

1) You open your inventory
   you see items:   sword, bag and a scroll of genocide
2) You press CTRL+O (open a container) and select the BAG
   you see items:   21 gold, 15 copper, purse, a letter
3) You press CTRL+O (open a container) and select the PURSE
   (you're now deep inside your inventory :)
4) You press the letter of a DIAMOND (single select withouth SHIFT)
5) the PURSE container screen will close, you're presented with
   a list of items inside the BAG
   You see that the DIAMOND is now in this directory
3) You press the letter of "DIAMOND" (single selection without SHIFT)
4) the BAG container screen will close and you see that the DIAMOND
   now exists in your main inventory.

Transferring items into a container
-----------------------------------

You can transfer items from the current inventory level to any container
which can be seen in the current level.

First select any items you would like to transfer into a container, then
press CTRL+T (move items into the container) and select the container you
want those items to be stored into.

Complex? Practise a little.


********************
FIGHTING AND BATTLES 
********************

During your adventuries you will be faced with many angry and hostile beings
whose only aim is to chop off that ugly head of yours. So you must either
fight them or try to run and flee away. Sadly life is not so easy as it
would seem to be, some monsters are faster than you so most probably you're
forced to fight. Oh, did I mention that some monsters are also more agile
than you, so you probably must flee anyway...


Picking up (some blood from your nose) a fight
----------------------------------------------

To fight, just move towards the position of the creature you want to
attack. You will get a message telling if you succeeded or not.

Every being in the game has fighting skills, so do you. These skills
determine your "worthiness" in the battle. The skill affects your learning
level with a specific weapon type. For example, with a high swords skill you
have a greater chance to hit your target and dodge when your opponent tries
to hit you.

When you fight, you will attack the different bodyparts of the target.  This
game uses a system of five bodyparts, all these bodyparts have their own
hitpoints and chance to hit value. So the smaller bodyparts are harder to
hit. 

Tactics will also affect your fighting skills. So be carefull when you pick
up a fight, check your tactics first. If you accidentally start fighting
with a powerfull swordsman who has a sword skill of 90% then you're probably
going to die in one blow with berzerk tactics.

In this version you can't yet select a tactic to target some specific
bodyparts. I hope to have that feature soon in the game.


*******
TACTICS
*******

You can select several different tactics which will affect the behaviour of
your character in several ways.

Here's a table describing the effect of the each tactic.

Tactic			Hit:	Dodge:	DAM:	AC:	SPD:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Coward			-30	+30	-4	+8	+30%
Very defensive		-20	+20	-2	+6	+20%
Defensive		-10	+10	-1	+4	+10%
Normal (default)	normal race/class values +-0 mod
Aggressive		+5	-10	+1	-4	no effect
Very aggressive		+10	-20	+2	-6	no effect
Berzerk			+20	-30	+4	-8	no effect

While all aggressive tactics are good when you try to issue some serious
damage in battles, they also can be extremely dangerous. While you have an
increased change to give more damage with a greater chance to hit you also
are easier target for your opponents.

With defensive tactics you're faster and have a greater chance to dodge hits
and flee from the battle but you have a lesser chance to hit your target. If
you hit, you will also make lesser damage.

A word of warning: Some monsters are known to use tactics too.



******
SKILLS
******

As I mentioned before, all creatures have a certain amount of
skills. There're skills which affect your battles and fighting, skills of
magic (spells) and some general skills which affect your allday living.

Skill learning is mostly automatic. You learn with experience, the more you
use your skills the more confident you get with them. 

Weaponless combat	
Daggers			
Swords		
Axes
Blunt weapons
Polearms
Staffs
Bows
Throwing
Two handed weapons
One handed weapons
Two weapon combat
(shield)

When you find a new weapon and you don't possess a skill for it yet, you
will learn the specific skill for that weapon type automagically when you
use your weapon successfully.

General skills:
---------------

Food gathering		
	This will affect your ability to take food out from corpses. You
	apply this skill automatically when you try to eat a corpse of some
	kind. The higher this skill is, the more food you get from the
	corpses.

Healing			
	This skill improves your normal healing rate. Every 10% on this
	skill will improve your success with this skill by 2.5 points.
	So at 100% you have a 25% chance to heal a point of damage on every
	turn. (at 50% you have 12.5% chance.)

Observation 
Alteration  
Mysticism   
Destruction 
	These four skills are actually magic skills, see below for more
	information.

Find weakness
	With this skill you can find weaknesses from your enemies. Causing
	more critical hits. 
	Every 10% of this skill will improve your chance to get critical hits
	by 2.5%. So at 100% you have a 1/4 chance to issue a critical hit.
	(25%)

Searching
	When you try searching ('s'-key) you will use this skill. It directly
	affects your ability to find hidden things/items/locations.
        Also affects your ability to notice some hidden things automatically
	if a "cautious-mode" or "searching-mode" is turned on. (":s")

Disarm Trap
	By applying this skill to any known trap you can try to disarm it.
	Failure to disarm a trap will most probably result the activation
	of the trap.

**********************
SKILL SELECTION WINDOW
**********************

Known skills can naturally be used, or else they would be rather
useless. Many of the skills (most for now) are automatic, and will be used
automagically in a correct situation. But you may know some skills which
require you to manually apply them.

There is a skill selection screen where you can select a skill you want to
use. This window can also be used for examining your skills.

There're two commands, one for all skills (key 's') and one for your spells
(magic skills) (key 'm'). 

When you issue the command, you will get a screen looking like this:


+========================+
|                        | Select a skill to apply.
| (1)      Curse         |
|         Confuze        | (2)
|        Identify        |
|        Teleport        |
|         Healing        |
|       ->Swords<-       |
|         Daggers        |
|     Food gathering     |
|       Destruction      |
|       Observation      | (3)
|         Staffs         | weapon skill *Automatic*
|          Bows          | Knowledge: 38% of 100% (promising)
|                        | Needs 117 marks to advance!
+========================+

The area (1) contains a scrolling list window displaying your known
skills. Scroll this window up/down with A/Z/UP/DOWN keys. The currently
selected skill will be highlighted in the center of the window.

Pressing '?' will give you a description the skill which is highlighted. The
description will appear on area (2).

Area (3) displays some information on the highlighted skill.

If you press ENTER or SPACE you will use the highlighted skill.  

Automatic skills and manual skills will be displayed in different color
within this window.

Within this screen you can mark skills as quick skills. You can do this by
pressing number keys 1 - 0 on. There're 10 slots for quick marked
skills. When you mark a skill you will see a number appear before the skill
name. This number tells you that the skill was assigned to the quick skill
slot of that number.

To use quick marked skills within the game, use commands :1 -> :0 .


***********************
ROAMING IN THE DUNGEONS
***********************

Dungeons can be very unhealthy places. It's not enough that they are filled
with lethal creatures, they also contain a lot of hidden traps and other
unhealthy features. For your own safety, you have the ability to search, use
it wisely. 

Not only traps are hidden, some passages may contain hidden doors and areas
as well. So, high searching skill is very important, not only for your safety.
It makes it easier to find those hidden things. 



****************
MAGIC AND SPELLS
****************

The magic in Salmorria is divided in four gategories. There're four schools
which teach spells. The schools are:

	The School of Observation
	The School of Alteration
	The School of Mysticism
	The School of Destruction

Your knowledge in each of these areas are marked by four skills, one for
each school of magic. These, apart from their magical nature, belong to the
group of generic skills.


Observation

	Observation skill is learned at the Magic School of Observation. The
	school teaches ways to examine the real nature of
	things. The skill itself affects directly to your Observation
	spells. Owning a high skill in this area produces more successes
	when casting spells of Observation. It also can affect your ability
	to learn new Observation spells.

Mysticism

	Mysticism skill is learned at the Magic School of Mysticism. The
	school teaches methods to create illusions and minor alterations
	of nature. The skill itself affects directly to your Mysticism
	spells. Owning a high skill in this area produces more successes
	when casting spells of Mysticism. It also can affect your ability to
	learn new Mysticism spells.

Alteration

	Alteration skill is learned at the Magic School of Alteration. The
	school teaches magical methods and ways to alter the nature of
	things. The skill itself affects directly to your Alteration
	spells. Owning a high skill in this area produces more successes
	when casting spells of Alteration. It also can affect your ability
	to learn new Alteration spells.

Destruction

	Destruction skill is learned at the Magic School of Destruction. The
	school teaches methods to permanently harm or destruct things of
	nature. The skill itself affects directly to your Destruction
	spells. Owning a high skill in this area produces more successes
	when casting spells of Destruction. It also can affect your ability
	to learn new Destruction spells.

These four skills will eventually make it possible to learn spells from
their gategory. And, if for example, you don't possess a skill of Mysticism
then all mysticism spells will be rather useless because you don't know how
to cast them.

The magic in Salmorria is young and developing rapidly. The mages are
constantly in the path of developing new spells and writing them down as
scrolls.

At the present time, Salmorrian mages have come up with these spells:

Identify
Bless
Curse
Neutralize
Teleport
Confuze
Magic map

********************
STATS AND ATTRIBUTES
********************

Your character has several attributes and stats.

Stats in Legend of Saladir are:

STR     Strength
TGH     Toughness
DEX     Dexterity
CON     Constitution
WIS     Wisdom
INT     Intelligence
CHA     Charisma

SPD     Speed, a derived attribute
LUC     Luck

Also, every Salmorrian item and being has an religious alignment, even if
it's not an item or creature of religion. 



*************************
ABOUT HITPOINTS AND ARMOR
*************************

Legend of Saladir has a "specialized" way to handle the hitpoints. Hitpoints
are a method to check in what physical condition a creature is. There are
five HP slots where these hitpoints are stored. These slots are, 

	Head,
	Left hand, 
	Right hand, 
	Body (chest) 
	Legs (both legs in one slot).

Not all creatures have hands, if the creature is a flying one, it has
wings/vanes etc. 

Of course, there're some creatures which have less bodyparts. Some of them
might not have legs for example. Ie. spiders don't have hands and worms and
snakes have only body and head.

Creature will die if the head or body hitpoints go below (or to) zero.  Also
it will die if the total amount of hitpoints, all slots calculated together,
fall below (or to) zero. So DON'T get confuzed if your adventurer dies when
the HP-value on the left side of the screen displays a value above 0.

Beware in combat, it's good to watch your slot hitpoints (ehm, slotpoints?)
because if your hand hitpoints fall to zero you will not be able to fight
anymore. Also walking is impossible with broken feet.  Protect your head and
body properly, they are the most vital parts of your body.

Armor will aid you in this. Some armor slots will protect many parts of the
body. For example, if you're wearing a magical cloak it will protect your
whole body and gloves with other hand armor will protect your hands and
arms.

This system is really in experimental phase, let's see if it works and what
modifications it will need.

Press 'A' during game to get your armor status. Press 'H' to get your
hitpoint status, detailed

Hitpoint regeneration happens when enough time has passed. Regeneration
happens randomly on the damaged bodyparts. Also, if you possess a healing
skill in your knowledge it can speed you your healing process.

You can set a hitpoints alarm from the configuration menu. There you can set
a percentage value between 0 and 100. The game will alert you when the
hitpoints on some of your bodyparts fall below that percentage of the
maximum hitpoints. It has been preset to 50%, and you can disable it by
configuring a value of 0.



********************************
ABOUT TIME AND CALENDAR AND FOOD
********************************

This version has a time and calendar built in. The calendar measures the
time passed in the world of Salmorria (The land where Saladir takes place).

Every move your character makes takes a certain amount of time. If you are
adventuring in the wilderness then the time passes faster. This is natural
because one dungeon/town grid is much smaller than one grid in the
wilderness map. Also beware that your food will be consumed faster when
you're hunting wolfes in the wilderness.

From V0.30 on the food system no longer uses a "time" based system. It uses
a more traditional methods. Who knows if it will work better.

You can access the calendar and passed time with ':T' and ':t'.



*******
WEAPONS
*******

If you have equipped two weapons, a one handed weapon in both of your hands,
remember that the RIGHT hand will attack first and the LEFT hand weapon will
be used if there is enough time left for your turn.

This might be changed in the next versions by introducing a feature "left
handed" or "right handed" person. At the moment you are right handed.

If you equip a two handed weapon you will not be able to use your other hand
because the weapon reserves it.

Bows and crossbows will also reserve your both hands. Have you tried
shooting with a bow and just one hand?

If your hands gets enough damage during the combat, your weapons will drop
down and you can't use your hand until it has healed.



**************
RANGED WEAPONS
**************

Version 0.31 brings another aspect to the art of fighting. Using bows and
crossbows it's now possible to tease your enemies without being next to
them. Just ready your arrows and your bow and shoot them. 

Any items can be used as missiles, but bows and crossbows can only shoot
arrows and bolts.

Ready missiles and missile weapons with the usual 'q' (eQuip) command. To
shoot a target, use 't' command.

After you've equipped a missile (ie arrow or bolt) for your missile equip
slot, you will always ready a new missile of the same type after shooting
the previous one. This is done until you run out of missiles of that type.

When you are targetting a missile ('t') the game will automatically select a
target in your sight. This is NOT the nearest target, it's the first visible
target. You can switch between visible targets by pressing 'n' during the
targetting mode. To shoot a missile, press either 't' or SPACE. 


*************
SHOPS & MONEY
*************

Money
-----

Money, in Salmorria, comes in three flavours: Gold, silver and copper
coins. Money can be founded from all around the dungeons where the most
unfortunate adventurers have died or forgotten something in a hurry while
running away from something big'n ugly.

Gold coins are naturally the most valuable of these three. The relationship
of these coins are like this:

                1 gold = 4 silver = 8 copper

                another approach:

                1 copper = 0.125 gold
                1 silver = 0.25 gold

You don't need to worry about this, the shopkeepers all around Salmorria
should have enough knowledge to bill you the right amount of money from your
purse. Report the authoritatives immendiately if you observe a shopkeeper
cheating you. There're laws set up against this kind of behaviour you know.

Shops
-----

Cities usually have shops of several types. Some of the most popular
dungeons can also have shops in them, althought they are much rarer in
dungeons. Most common types of shops to find are general stores, armour and
weapon shops and the food markets, libraries and magic shops are rarer.

Every shop has a shopkeeper who also is the owner of the shop. He will
assure that all customers will also pay their bills and he will also alert
guards for thieves if necessary. Shopkeepers are generally very unhappy
people, they're always complaining about something, someone or just nagging
for fun. Don't care too much about them. Just pay your bill and everything
is fine (from the shopkeepers point of view). There're so many thieves
around on these days, you can almost understand some of the anger carried by
the shopkeepers.

Buying stuff
------------

When you walk around the shop, you will see descriptions of the items stored
in the shelves. The description is always followed by a price tag, this is
the amount you must pay to have that item for yourself. To buy an item, just
pick it up (with ',') and pay for it with 'B' if you don't want to try
stealing it. However, stealing might be quite difficult since the
shopkeepers are keen to guard the door area when a customer is inside the
shop. (anti-instruction: To steal something you just have to get the item
outside by some means.)

Selling stuff
-------------

Use your drop key ('d') to sell items inside the shop. When you drop
something the shopkeeper will ask you if you want to sell the item.  During
this question (s)he also makes you an offer on the item in question.

Some shops accept only the specific types of items. Ie. You can't sell food
inside a weapon store. General stores generally accept everything.

Prices
------

Shops usually define their prices in gold coins. So when you pay your bill
your purse will be checked if the total sum of your gold, silver and copper
is enough to pay your bill. Shopkeepers will always take the gold first then
go to the silver and last (but not least) take the copper away.

As a free service, the shopkeeper will at this time also exchange your
smaller coins for bigger ones. Copper will be changed to silver and gold if
you have enough for the exchange.


Bill (not Gates :)
----

You can check out your current bill (unpaid items total) with 'B' and pay
your debts with 'P'. Currently you can only pay for ALL collected items at
once, so collect only those items you want to pay for before pressing
P. Later there might be a new feature which allows you to pay items one by
one.


Note on shops
.............


To make stealing a bit harder, shops are usually designed so that diagonal
movements are not possible towards the shop entrance area. You must pass
through the cash register to get out.



**********************
DISPLAY AND VISIBILITY
**********************

Your adventures will always be displayed from the overhead map. You can
always see the areas you've already visited but not the items and creatures
located in them. Items and/or creatures will only show up when you have are
near enough to see them and you have a line-of-sight from your position to
the position of the item/creature. 

Your character has only a limited range of visibility and (s)he can't see
behind the corners in any cases. This visibility is simulated with a
Line-of-Sight system. Basic idea is just as simple as it could be, you can
see monsters and items if there are no obstacles between you and the item
and if the distance is low enough. Creatures are not handled as an obstacle
in the current state of the game.

While you walk, items will pop up from the border areas of your sight range
and disappear from the another border.

If you're not carrying light, you will not see nothing but the walls of the
dungeons as you remember them. 

By using 'l' (look around) command you can examine your surroundings. BUT
only those locations you can see. You can't examine dark areas without
light, you can't look over walls and so on.


*********
MATERIALS
*********

In the Salmorrian Mountains there are many caves and dungeons, and those are
filled with many types of items. Every item has been made out of some
material (well almost every item). Some of the materials are better, some
are worse. Some materials are more valuable than the others and some
materials are better in combat, lasting longer and giving more protection
and damage, maybe even speed and other valuable bonuses.

Naturally, most valuable materials are found less often. So when you find
something special, take it away even if you don't need it right away, it
might not be there next time you pass by and you could earn a few gold
pieces by selling the item at the nearest general store.




*****************
TORCHES AND LIGHT
*****************

Some areas in the world are dark and unlit. You must bring the light with
you because unlit rooms can be very dangerous places for careless
adventurers. (I can say that with experience)

Using light items
-----------------

You must be wielding a light for it to work. The lantern or torch must be in
your left or right hand.

In this version you don't have to light the lantern on, it will be done for
you. And another gimmick of this version, the light doesn't burn out.



**************
CONFIG OPTIONS
**************

There're several options which can be changed from inside the game.  You can
press '\'-key to get a (primitive) interface to these options.

To set a particular option you must type the keyword for that option you
want to modify. To get a list of all available options, use '?'  when
prompted for the option keyword.

There're three types of variables, string, integer and boolean.

String variables can contain any character string.  Integer variables can
contain negative or positive integers.  Boolean variables can contain just a
"true" or "false" strings. When you quit the game, it saves all these
options to a text file so they can be restored in your later sessions.

Here's a list of currently available options and their descriptions.

ITEMDISTURB Boolean, (true)
	    If true, walk mode will abort when you walk on an item.

MONSTERDISTURB Boolean (true)
	    If true, walk mode will abort when a monster is in your
	    sight

DOORDISTURB Boolean, (true)
	    If true, walk mode will abort when a door is next to your
	    location, in any direction.

STAIRDISTURB Boolean, (true)
	    If true, walk mode will abort if you walk to a location of
	    staircase

REPEATUPDATE Boolean, (true)
	    If true, screen will be updated when you're in walk mode.

COMPACTMSG  Boolean, (true)
	    If true, repeated messages will be compacted inside the message
	    buffer.

COLORMSG    Boolean, (true)
            If true, you get all colored messages as in previous versions.
	    But if you disable this option, all messages come in whiter

PICKUPTYPES String, ("%$")
	    If "all", all item types will be taken automagically.

	     automagically.

GETALLMONEY Boolean, (true)  
	    If true, when getting money (gold, silver and copper) from
	    the ground, all coins will be taken at once.  
	    If false, you will be asked how many coins you want to get

DROPPILES   Boolean, (false)
	    If true, item piles will be dropped at once without any
	    questions. If false (default) you will be asked for the 
	    item count.

AUTODOOR    Boolean, (false)
            If true, doors will be opened automagically when you move to 
            them. Some doors might still require multiple attempts to open.

REPEATCOUNT Integer, (50)
	    Default repeat count for repeatable commands (walk mode).

HEALTHALARM Integer, (50)
	    If the health points in any of your bodyparts fall below
	    this percentage of the maximum, you will get a warning.

	    Only usable for debugging.



*********** 
TEXT VIEWER 
*********** 

(V0.31) There's a simple internal text viewer inside the game. Some of the
internal commands will use this viewer for displaying textual information. 

	For example:

	:?k    keyboard help
	:?m    manual
	:m     message buffer

Keyboard commands for the viewer are:

	PAGE UP/-	previous page
	PAGE DOWN/+	next page
	HOME/t          top of text
	END/b		bottom of text
        8/UP            scroll line up
        2/DOWN          scroll line down




*************
GAME CRASHED?
*************

From version 0.27 on the game contains a simple error handler which should
handle the most common errors. (Somehow, it doesn't seem to work under
Linux!?)

The game is in early development state so there probably are many unseen
bugs roaming around the code.

If such an error happens, Saladir reports it to you and writes an error
report to a file named as SALADIR.ERR. This is a plain text file containing
some information collected from the game at the time the game crashed. If
you see such a file floating on your HD, send it to me.

THANKS AND CREDITS
******************

 This part is to be a place for thank yous and credits for this game.
 Currently it's not very big but here are the persons I owe much.

 More personal thanks to the following persons (and cats):

 o Thomas "The very corrupted adventurer" Biskup

        Yes, dude, it's you who helped me when I was starting this game.
        Remember those awfull questions about some particular coding
        stuff. It really helped me a lot, without your help, I think it
	would've proven quite impossible to port my game for Linux. Now
	it went out quite painlessly. 

        Also, I think it's VERY noticeable that my game looks similar to
        ADOM in many parts. I've tried NOT TO COPY anything but I really
        like ADOM very much and I play it very much too. I want to make
        some things like ADOM does. Thanks for making such a great game
        like Ancient Domains of Mystery is.

 o William Tanksley

        For providing a really great random number generator for my
        roguelike game. Life would be a pain without your routine.
 
 o Darren Hebden, the roguenews guy.

        Thank you for posting announcements of my game to your news
        page! Also thanks for many nice ideas you posted on the
        mailinglist.

 o Jarno "da lil'bro" Tuomainen

        For being my victim in the test process. Countless times I've
        sent him new versions of Saladir and countless times has he
        tested them with his NT-machine. Thanks, and please be my victim
        in the future too.

 o Osku Salerma

	For being my victim in the test process. He has downloaded
	countless Linux versions and sacrificed his system for my
	"unknown" attacks. Thanks also for the nice discussion we have
	concerning the development of roguelike games. Let's hope you
	have something to announce some day... :-)

 o Suvi

        My girlfriend who doesn't get mad even I stay up almost the
        whole night with my computer.

 o Inka and Natasha

        My two female cats who have accompanied my lonely coding nights
        by sitting on my lap. Meoww..

 Thanks for all nice ideas and other suggestions for Saladir: (in
 alphabetical order):

	Chris Allcock.
	Thomas Biskup,
	Douglas Goodall, 
	Darren Hebden,
	Rune Jarnæs,
	Osku Salerma,
        Michael R. Taylor,
        Jarno Tuomainen.
