Legend of Saladir
Update 03/2019

This is a textmode roguelike RPG game which is intended to run in
console/terminal or DOS box.

Project died in 1999 and has not been continued since. Code is
ugly and not reusable nor extendable. Don't take this as an
example for good programming/designing practises :-)

It has poor design and no tests but the game engine itself 
has advanced features. Game does not have very much content
but is completely playable.

When game has been started and character has been created
press ? to read the instructions. Or check out the file
"manual.txt" in help/ folder in sources.

Under Linux it should build by just executing "make" in the main
source directory. You need GCC and ncurses library. Before
compiling "saladir" itself, you need to compile certain utils
under utils/ directory
	cd utils
	make

On Ubuntu install by typing:
	sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
	sudo apt-get install gcc

To build:
	make
	./saladir

Windows build has not been tested for 10 years!
