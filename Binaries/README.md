Compiling Saladir is currently challenging atleast in Windows environment. There is a lot of legacy stuff in the code which needs to be modified all the way from the build chain to the game code itself.

I decided to include the latest Windows binaries which was the last release in 1999 or so. It is an old compilation with DJGPP compiler using and it's using a DPMI memory extender so it won't work with modern windows.

BUT! You can run it by using DosBox which allows you to run old DOS based applications and games in modern environments. You can find it from here:

If I have time I will fix the build so Saladir can be built with e.g. GCC or MINGW64 on Windows.

Last time I tested building it with Linux it worked. But it was some years ago.

Thanks,
